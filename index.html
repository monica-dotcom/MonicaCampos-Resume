        <div class="subheading mb-5">Biochemistry ðŸ§¬</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Monica Campos, and I am currently a senior at UC Riverside studying biochemistry. In 2019, I transferred from Santa Monica College (SMC) where I was a co-founder of a Women of Color in STEM organization. I have a huge passion for mentoring women of color interested in the STEM field since we are an underrepresented group in this field. My interest in the STEM field comes from my background and growing up in an underserved minority community near Venice Beach. Growing up my K-12 education was not the best, so I was never a college-bound student when I enrolled at SMC. Neither one of my parents went to college let alone finished middle school so without initial guidance it was very difficult to navigate the educational system. My academic journey at SMC started off as such a culture shock to me, I had little to no clue on how to study or be a student. <br><br>

        When I enrolled at SMC I was placed in the lowest math and English level but starting from scratch led me to became aware of my interest in mathematics. Semester after semester I found myself getting good enough grades that it propelled me to be optimistic and seek out new challenges. I was fortunate to find mentors and access to the STEM Program at SMC, who have fostered a supportive environment and taught me the value of networking and advocacy. In the STEM Program I was given opportunities to push myself and take risks such as applying to internships at UCLA, USC and even at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) at NASA. Despite my uncertainties of not having good enough grades, I was selected among a group of candidates to participate in these internships and gain first-hand experience in working in a research lab. <br><br>

        In late 2019 when I transferred to UC Riverside, I had the opportunity to use the qualities I gained at SMC and seek out a supportive environment. Which is where I found the opportunity to participate in an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) partnered internship where I learned about food waste and the negative effects it has to the environment. My journey to this point was filled with adversity and challenges that I was able to overcome and continue to overcome but most importantly it gave me the experiences and confidence I needed to go forward. Forward to a lifelong dream of becoming a doctor and serving underserved minority communities like the one I grew up in.
